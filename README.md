# CUTE AND COOL OPENSPACE ORGANIZER BY LEA KONINCKS

To run my organiser from the terminal, type ```python main.py```\
Or run it from VS-Code, works very well too !
... and the program will take care of your needs !

Oh and by the way, the organizer uses the following packages, so make sure you have them installed.\
**random**\
**os**\
**pandas**\
**xslxwriter**

To install a package, I like to use ```pip install package_name```


I added a few files to play with in the main folder : hobbits.xlsx, aliens.xslx and goblins.xslx\
The purpose of these was to offer a variety of situations during development, as well as refreshing funny names !

**Hobbits** are well mannered and come in exactly the right amount for the openspace that we have set : 6 tables and 4 chairs per table.\
**Aliens** are shy and many didn't come...\
**Goblins** just don't care, they invited all their friends !

Please feel free to add your bunch of colleagues to this fantastical zoo !
